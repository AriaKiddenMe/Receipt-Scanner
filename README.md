# Receipt-Scanner
The goal of this application is to help customers save money by scanning receipts and comparing weight and unit prices of food items across nearby grocery stores. This thereby gives customers awareness of which store has the better deals for a set of specific items and, as a result, gives them the ability to plan and save for future purchases
